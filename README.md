## What is the Guessing Game?
The game is called "Guess the Number". The program thinks of an integer within a known range. The player tries to guess the number. If the guess is incorrect, then the program tells the  player whether the guess was too high or too low. Eventually, the player guesses the correct number. The player's score equals the number of guesses he made.

- In this game, the program generates random number but this number is not visible to the player.
- Player tries to guess the number. If the player enters the same number that is generated by system then program displays the winning message and game ends there.
- If the player enters wrong number then that number is evaluated. If the number is greater than right answer than system gives a hint that entered number is ‘high’ otherwise if number is smaller than right answer than it says ‘lower’.

Here is the basic demonstration of python number guessing game. In this game correct answer is 10 and user has unlimited chances to guess the number.
